# Currency Calculator  

## Description  
this is a little currency calculator, which was a 2nd semester cs task.  
it is written in java and has some documentation on almost everything.  
the gui is pretty intuitive to use, incase of errors feel free to correct me.  

features:  
  calculates and displays exchange rates inbetween currencies  
  incase the asInterface is   
    chosen allows to add further currencies  
    allows to change the exchange rate (default here is euro, so 1 euro == n other currency)  
    saves the currencies after every change  
  some code documentation (also javadocs, however not in github stored, but can be easily created with the code as the needed comments are already there)  

plans:  
  basically done (project is finished in class), but  
    possible future changes: making it so, that changing euro changes all the other currencies
